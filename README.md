├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md

THE PURPOSE OF THE ABOVE FILES

index.ts The main TypeScript file that runs the logic. It gets input, calculates age, and shows output.

package.json Tells Node.js how to run the app, what dependencies (like ts-node) are needed, and metadata about the project.

tsconfig.json Configuration file for TypeScript. It tells the compiler how to convert TypeScript code into JavaScript

README.md A friendly guide for any developer who opens your project — explains how to run it, install it, and upload to GitHub.

node_modules/ (created after npm install) Folder that stores all your libraries/dependencies like ts-node. You don't manually edit this.
